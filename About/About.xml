Adds a "stuffed" version of every vinilla rimworld animal. 
These animals act as pieces of art, however they are built not crafted.
Animals require some wood and appropriate leather. Animals that do not give leather, require cloth instead.
Elephants also require tusks, and Thrumbos require a horn, They give more beauty for this reason.
